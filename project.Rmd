## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data <- read.csv("lap_times.csv")
dataHam <- subset(data, driverId==1)
dataHambef <- subset(dataHam, raceId==841)
dataHamnow <- subset(dataHam, raceId==1076)
plot.new()
lines(as.vector(dataHambef[,"lap"]),
 as.vector(dataHambef[,"milliseconds"]), lty = 1, col = "red")

lines(as.vector(dataHamnow[,"lap"]),
 as.vector(dataHamnow[,"milliseconds"]), lty = 1, col = "green")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
